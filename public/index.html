      <p> Hello! Welcome to my portfolio website. My name is Christoper Alan Steiner, 
        but you can just call me Chris. I am currently a freshman at the Rose-Hulman 
        Institute of Technology studying Computer Science, and am extremely passionate 
        about computers! Aside from just writing code, I do graphic design, photo editing,
        video editing, and 3D modelling/sculpting. </p>

      <p> I aim to eventually become a full-stack software developer, who not only writes 
        efficient reliable code, but who also creates things which are easy to use and 
        beautiful to look at. Contact me if you have any interest in making use of my 
        talents and passion, or if you are able to provide some way for me to further my 
        learning! </p>
        
      <p> Thanks for stopping by! </p>
